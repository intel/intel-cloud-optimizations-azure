# Intel® Cloud Optimization Modules for Microsoft Azure* 

© Copyright 2023, Intel Corporation

## XGBoost* Kubeflow* Pipeline

The Intel® Cloud Optimization Modules for Microsoft Azure*: XGBoost* Kubeflow* Pipeline is designed to facilitate building and deploying accelerated AI applications on [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/). Kubeflow is the simple, portable, and scalable Machine Learning toolkit for Kubernetes services. This reference solution provides an optimized training and inference Kubeflow Pipeline using XGBoost to predict the probability of a loan default. The module enables the use of [Intel® Optimizations for XGBoost*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/optimization-for-xgboost.html), [Intel® oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onedal.html), and [Intel® Extension for Scikit-Learn*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/scikit-learn.html) in a full end-to-end reference architecture. It also leverages secure and confidential computing using the [Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html) virtual machines on an [Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service) cluster.

## Cloud Solution Architecture

This cloud solution utilizes an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster, with the central components being the Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) virtual machines (VMs). Intel Software Guard Extensions VMs allow you to run sensitive workloads and containers within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). TEEs enable user-level code from containers to allocate private regions of memory to execute the code with CPU directly. These private memory regions that execute directly with CPU are called enclaves. Enclaves help protect the data confidentiality, data integrity and code integrity from other processes running on the same nodes, as well as Azure operator. An Azure Container Registry is attached to the AKS cluster so that the Kubeflow pipeline can build the containerized Python components. These Azure resources are managed in an Azure Resource Group. The Kubeflow software layer is then installed on the AKS cluster. When the pipeline is run, each pipeline pod will be assigned to an Intel SGX node.

## Pipeline Overview

This pipeline is derived from the [Loan Default Risk Prediction AI Reference Kit](https://github.com/oneapi-src/loan-default-risk-prediction), built by Intel in collaboration with Accenture*. The code has been enhanced through refactoring to achieve better modularity and suitability for Kubeflow Pipelines. The credit risk data set used in the pipeline is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset)* and synthetically augmented for testing and benchmarking purposes. Below is a graph of the full XGBoost daal4py Kubeflow Pipeline.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/intel-xgb-d4p-pipeline.png" alt="Intel XGBoost Daal4py Pipeline"/>
</p>

The pipeline consists of the following 7 components:  
- **Load data**: This component loads the `credit_risk_dataset.csv` from the URL specified 
and performs synthetic data augmentation.  
- **Create training and test sets**: This component splits the data into training and test 
sets, of an approximately 75:25 split for model evaluation.  
- **Preprocess features**: This component performs data preprocessing of the training and test 
sets by transforming categorical features using one-hot encoding, imputing missing values, 
and power transforming numerical features.  
- **Train XGBoost model**: This component trains an XGBoost model, or continues training 
the model if selected, and stores the model in the Azure file share.  
- **Convert XGBoost model to Daal4py**: This component converts the XGBoost model to an
inference-optimized daal4py classifier.  
- **Daal4py Inference**:  This component computes predictions using the inference-optimized 
daal4py classifier and evaluates model performance. It returns an output summary of the 
precision, recall, F1 score for each class, as well as the area under the curve (AUC) and 
accuracy of the model.  
- **Plot ROC Curve**: This component performs model validation on the test data 
and generates a graph of the ROC curve.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Azure resources for this module, please ensure you have 
downloaded and installed the required versions of the dependencies
[here](../../README.md#prerequisites).

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Setting up Azure Resources

### I. Sign in with the Azure CLI
To sign into your account interactively, use:

```
az login
```

### II. Create a Resource Group
We will first create an 
[Azure Resource Group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview#resource-groups) 
to hold all of the related resources for our solution. The command below will create 
a resource group named `intel-aks-kubeflow` in the `westus` region.

```
export RG=intel-aks-kubeflow
export LOC=westus

az group create -n $RG -l $LOC
```

### III. Create a Container Registry

Next, we'll create an 
[Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) 
to build, store, and manage the container image for our application. The command below 
will create a new container registry named `kubeflowregistry`.

```
export ACR=kubeflowregistry

az acr create --resource-group $RG \
--name $ACR \
--sku Standard
```

Before pushing and pulling container images, first log in to the registry 
using the command below.

```
az acr login -n $ACR
```

Next, we will build the image needed for the Kubeflow pipeline using the Dockerfile 
provided in this repository and push it to the container registry. We will name our 
image `intel-xgboost-daal4py` with the tag `latest`.

```
az acr build --image intel-xgboost-daal4py:latest --registry $ACR -g $RG --file Dockerfile .
```

Run the following command to verify the application image was successfully 
pushed to the repository:

```
az acr repository show -n $ACR --repository intel-xgboost-daal4py -o table
```

Your output should be similar to:
```
CreatedTime                   ImageName              LastUpdateTime                ManifestCount    Registry                     TagCount
----------------------------  ---------------------  ----------------------------  ---------------  ---------------------------  ----------
2023-04-24T21:03:51.1741697Z  intel-xgboost-daal4py  2023-04-24T21:03:51.2592323Z  1                kubeflowregistry.azurecr.io  1
```

### IV. Create an AKS Cluster with Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) Confidential Computing Nodes
Now we're ready to deploy our [Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) cluster with confidential computing nodes leveraging [Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html) Virtual Machines (VMs). 

Intel Software Guard Extensions VMs allow you to run sensitive workloads and containers within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). TEEs allow user-level code from containers to allocate private regions of memory to execute the code with CPU directly. These private memory regions that execute directly with CPU are called enclaves. Enclaves help protect the data confidentiality, data integrity and code integrity from other processes running on the same nodes, as well as Azure operator. These machines are powered by 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon Scalable processors, and use Intel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 to reach 3.5 GHz.

To set up the confidential computing node pool, we'll first create an AKS cluster with the confidential computing add-on enabled, `confcom`. This will create a system node pool that will host the AKS system pods, like `CoreDNS` and `metrics-server`. Executing the command below will create a node pool with a [`Standard_D4_v5`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv5-dsv5-series) VM. We'll provision a standard [Azure Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/load-balancer-standard) for our cluster and attach the container registry we created in the previous step, which will allow our cluster to pull images from the registry.

```
export AKS=aks-intel-sgx-kubeflow

az aks create --resource-group $RG \
--name $AKS \
--node-count 1 \
--node-vm-size Standard_D4_v5 \
--enable-managed-identity \
--generate-ssh-keys -l $LOC \
--load-balancer-sku standard \
--enable-addons confcom \
--attach-acr $ACR
```

To check that the registry was attached to the cluster successfully, run the following command: 
```
az aks check-acr -n $AKS -g $RG --acr kubeflowregistry.azurecr.io
```

Your output should be similar to: 

>[2023-04-24T01:57:25Z] Validating image pull permission: SUCCEEDED  
>[2023-04-24T01:57:25Z]  
>Your cluster can pull images from kubeflowregistry.azurecr.io!


Once the system node pool has been deployed, we'll add the Intel SGX VM node pool to the cluster using an instance of the [DCSv3 series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dcv3-series). The name of the confidential node pool is `intelsgx`, which will be referenced when scheduling our pods in the Kubeflow Pipeline.

```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group $RG \
--name intelsgx \
--cluster-name $AKS \
--node-vm-size Standard_DC4s_v3 \
--node-count 2 \
--labels intelvm=sgx
```

Once the Intel SGX node pool has been added, obtain the cluster access credentials and merge them into your local `.kube/config` file using the command below:
```
az aks get-credentials -n $AKS -g $RG
```

A [Kubernetes Label](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) has been added to the Intel SGX node pool. This label will be referenced in the Kubeflow Pipeline to assign the pods to one of the Intel SGX nodes. To verify that the label was successfully added to the nodes, use:

```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep -e "intelvm=sgx"
```

To verify that the confidential computing node pool has been created properly and the SGX-related DaemonSets are running, use the following commands:
```
kubectl config current-context
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see 2 nodes beginning with the name `aks-intelsgx` similar to the output below: 
```
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
aks-intelsgx-10192822-vmss000000    Ready    agent   2m15s   v1.25.5
aks-intelsgx-10192822-vmss000001    Ready    agent   2m15s   v1.25.5
```

To check that the 
[SGX device plugin](https://github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes#sgx-device-plugin) 
has been created properly, run the following command:
```
kubectl get pods -A
```

In the `kube-system` namespace, you should see 2 pods running with the name 
`sgx-plugin` similar to the output below: 
```
kube-system         sgx-plugin-xxxxx                                     1/1     Running   0          4m5s
```

If you see the above node pool and pods running, this means our AKS cluster is now ready to run confidential applications.
